# Sangdon Lim

I am a psychometrician specializing in computerized adaptive testing (CAT). I have publications in top-notch journals including *Psychological Methods* and *Psychometrika*, and have worked on multiple industry-sponsored CAT projects. I also happen to be a [cat]({% link cat.md %}) person.

# Experience
* Psychometrician, Cambium Assessment<span class="rightaligned">2023.09 - current</span><!-- timespan checked -->
* Graduate Research Assistant, University of Texas at Austin<span class="rightaligned">2022.09 - 2023.08</span>
  - Worked as the main programmer of two R packages for performing adaptive test assembly simulations. These
were contracted products for operational use.
  - Presented technical information to psychometrician and non-psychometrician audiences.
  - Caught where technical specifications were incomplete; discussed these with contracting organizations.
  - Led workshops in national conferences, both in-person and remotely.
  - Worked on adding features to R packages to facilitate studies led by colleagues.
  - Aided extensively in computer programming topics, such as making functions run faster, helping colleagues to learn version control and on general debugging, and making code easier to understand.

Topics included performing scale linking between instruments using item response theory and fixed-parameter calibration technique, performing adaptive test assembly simulations, and adding features to summarize item pool and test properties. These packages are publicly available from the CRAN repository.
  - Wrote package function help pages, tutorials, user guides, and technical documentations.
